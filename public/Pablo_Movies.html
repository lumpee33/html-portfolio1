<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Neo (Keanu Reeves) believes that Morpheus 
    (Laurence Fishburne), an elusive figure considered to be 
    the most dangerous man alive, can answer his question -- 
    What is the Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity 
    (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him 
    into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. 
    They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a 
    cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. 
    It is a truth that could cost Neo something more 
    precious than his life.</p>

<h3>Escape to Victory</h3>
<p>The head of a German POW camp, soccer enthusiast 
    Karl von Steiner (Max von Sydow) organizes a match 
    between Nazi players and their Allied captives. 
    Orchestrated as a way to push the Third Reich agenda, 
    the high-profile game is set to feature an 
    international team led by John Colby (Michael Caine), 
    a veteran British player. While the team, 
    which also includes Luis Fernandez (Pel√©) of Trinidad, 
    trains for the match, Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone) 
    plans a dangerous mass escape from the camp.</p>

<h3>The Good, The Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>In the Southwest during the Civil War, 
    a mysterious stranger, Joe (Clint Eastwood), 
    and a Mexican outlaw, Tuco (Eli Wallach), 
    form an uneasy partnership -- 
    Joe turns in the bandit for the reward money, 
    then rescues him just as he is being hanged. 
    When Joe's shot at the noose goes awry during one escapade
    , a furious Tuco tries to have him murdered. 
    The men re-team abruptly, however, 
    to beat out a sadistic criminal and the Union army 
    and find $20,000 that a soldier has buried in the desert.</p>
